# Achievement 6 – Happiness & Economic Factors

This project analyzes global happiness data from the 2019 World Happiness Report to explore how economic and social factors relate to reported well-being across countries.

The analysis was completed as part of Achievement 6 and combines exploratory data analysis in Python with interactive visual storytelling in Tableau.

## Project Objectives

- Explore global patterns in happiness scores across countries  
- Examine relationships between happiness and key socio-economic factors, including:
  - GDP per capita  
  - Social support  
  - Healthy life expectancy  
- Identify which variables are most strongly associated with happiness  
- Communicate findings using clear visualizations and narrative explanations  

---

## Data Source

- World Happiness Report (2019)  
- One row per country  
- Includes happiness scores and multiple socio-economic indicators

## Tableau Visualization

An interactive Tableau story was created to present key findings visually, including:

## Limitations

- Cross-sectional data from a single year  
- Correlation does not imply causation  
- Happiness scores are self-reported and may be culturally influenced  

---

## Next Steps

- Incorporate multiple years of happiness data to analyze trends over time  
- Include additional variables such as inequality or political stability  
- Apply more advanced modeling techniques for deeper analysis
