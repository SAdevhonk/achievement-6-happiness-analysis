# Achievement 6 – Happiness & Economic Factors

This project analyzes global happiness data from the 2019 World Happiness Report to examine how selected socio-economic factors relate to reported well-being across countries.

The work was completed as part of Achievement 6 using Python for data analysis and Tableau for visualization.
